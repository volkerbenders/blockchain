# BlockChain

## What Napster, Gambeling and BitCoin have in common

# Intro

BlockChain is the technology behind buzzwords like Crypto-Currency and Smart Contracts.

???

BlockChain is an amazing topic with too many aspects to mention them all.
So, these pages will give a rough overview of the technology. Some example code is shown.


---


# What is BlockChain

Basicly it's just a list to store informtion in a tamper proof way

--

Everybody can add virtually anything to the chain

--

All participants are connected by a p2p network. They're called nodes.

--

The network distributes and syncs the entire list to all nodes.
> That's where Napster comes in.

# What is BlockChain

## Key Aspects

--

* Block - Information is stored in blocks - hence the 1st part of the name.
  Each block stores meta data (timestamp, link to its predecessor...)

--

* Hash - Each block has a hash value. By checking this value it can be checked if this node has been changed after adding it to the chain
--

* Chain - Blocks are stored in a list - this is the 2nd part of the name

--

* Decentralized - The entire list / BlockChain is distributed to each node in the network

--

* Proof of work - Before adding a new Block one has to solve a riddle

--

* Participants are identified by hashes - not names

---

# What is BlockChain

## Key Aspects

### Blocks

Blocks are described by

--

* consecutive number

--

* timestamp

--

* cryptographic hash

--

* link to the previous block

--

# Block implemented in with JavaScript

```JavaScript
class Block {
  constructor(data, prevHash) {
    this.id = 0
    this._timestamp = Date.now()
    this._data = data
    this._prevHash = prevHash
    this._hash = this.calcHash()
  }
  ...
```

???

Getters / Setters and methods have been omitted for the sake of simplicity
---

## Adding data

Adding data is simple.
--

1. Get the most recent version of the BlockChain

--

2. Build a new Block with your data and the hash of the last block

--

3. Add the block to the chain of blocks.

--

4. Upload `your` copy of the list to the network

--

In theory you're done.

---

## Adding data

### JavaScript


```JavaScript
const lastBlock = myBlockChain[chain.length - 1]
const data = 'Sarah kauft für €0.50 Knete'

var linkedBlock = new Block(data, lastBlock.hash)

linkedBlock.id = lastBlock.id + 1
linkedBlock.calcHash()

myBlockChain.push(linkedBlock)
```


Of course this is over simplified.

---

## Adding data

### Proof of work

We've learned the blockchain network is open to everyone.
How do we prevent someone from flooding / spamming our chain?

Solution: We require all participants to solve a riddle before they're allowed to add a new Block to the chain.

This is he gambeling aspect.
???

The idea is to make it inefficient or impossible to spam the blockchain network

---

## Adding data

### BitCoin: Proof of work

In the BitCoin blockchain the riddle is to find a hash that starts with a certain number of zeros.

Wait a minute.

>What does 'find a hash that starts in a certain way' mean?

???

As long as the block data doesn't change the hash function will always yield the same hash value!

## Adding data

### BitCoin: Proof of work - some details on the used crypto hash function

> SHA-256 produces 256 bits which is 32 bytes, not characters, each byte has 256 possible values.

> There are 256 bits and each bit has 2 values (0 or 1), thus 2^256.
There are 32 bytes and each byte has 256 values, thus 256^32.
Note: 2^256 == 256^32 ~= 10^77.

That's 10^77 possible values a hash can have.

> Kornreich used a very rough estimate of 10 trillion galaxies in the universe. Multiplying that by the Milky Way's estimated 100 billion stars results in a large number indeed: 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 stars, or a "1" with 24 zeros after it

There are 32 bytes and each byte has 256 values, thus 256^32.

[According to wikipedia]()

That's 10^77 possible values a hash can have.

> According to [space.com](https://www.space.com/26078-how-many-stars-are-there.html) ther're roughly about 10 trillion galaxies x 100 billion stars in the universe.

Thats 10^77 possible hash values vs. 10^14 stars in th universe.

### BitCoin: Proof of work

In the BitCoin network the proof of work is:

> Find a hash value that starts with a certain number of zeros.

Of course compute power constantly increases. People turned away from using standard PCs and user special hardware to mine more more blocks.
The network increased the number of zeros you'd need to find.

Special video cards with GPUs and stuff are used.

The network copes with this by increasing the difficulty level and require more zeros to be found.

## Adding data

### BitCoin: Proof of work - JavaScript example

```javascript
calculateHash() {
        return SHA256(this.index \
            + this.previousHash \
            + this.timestamp \
            + JSON.stringify(this.data) \
            + this.nonce) \
            .toString();
    }
```

```javascript
mineBlock(difficulty) {
  while (this.hash.substring(0, difficulty) !== Array(difficulty + 1).join("0")) {
      this.nonce++;
      this.hash = this.calculateHash();
  }
  console.log("BLOCK MINED: " + this.hash);
}
```

Nonce means
You may notice `nonce`.
> Number used once - used to ensure a new hash value for the same block data.
